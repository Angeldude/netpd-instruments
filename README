netpd2-patches
==============

This is the place where I work on imported patches
from the old netpd framework, trying to adapt them
for the new netpd2

This is very much work in progress at this state.
Consider it not even alpha yet.

Please refer also to the netpd2 repository:

         imported patch or abstraction)
