netpd2-patches
==============

This is the place where I work on imported patches
from the old netpd framework, trying to adapt them
for the new netpd2

This is very much work in progress, though many 
instruments have already been ported.

Please refer also to the netpd2 repository:

         imported patch or abstraction)
