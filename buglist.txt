  * erase all functionality is missing


master-poly

  * strange stack overflow bug
    In order to reproduce:
     - load drummer, drimmer and qseq3
     - start another instance of netpd2
     - make sure all patches and abs are there
       but these two: qseq3, rh_scalelin.pd
     - start unpatch on second instance
     -> stack overflow
